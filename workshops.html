        <h2>CALL FOR PROPOSALS</h2>

      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

      <div class="page-text">
       We invite you to submit proposals for workshops to be held at CSCW 2026, in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Workshops are pre-conference events to meet new attendees, share ideas, and discuss research. Workshops at CSCW 2026 are one-day events. <strong>Please note that all workshops at CSCW 2026 will be in person. The conference organizing team and the conference facility are not able to provide support for hybridity. </strong>
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        Topics may be about anything relevant to the CSCW community. We encourage workshops for newer and more emergent areas as well as proposals that bring together diverse voices in our community, both in terms of organizers and participants. For instance, we expect workshop proposals to include organizers from a diverse team as much as possible. We define diversity as representing different parts of the world, institutions, research approaches, and identities.
       </div>
      
      <div class="page-text">
        We encourage you to consider new and exciting formats that can use the workshop timeslot and space for creative and “non-traditional” workshops. In past CSCW conferences, this has included data or research jams, hackathon-style coding events, science slams, collaborative and open writing groups, and other non-traditional uses of the workshop format. 
      </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        The Workshop Chairs’ priority is to create a carefully curated workshop program that will appeal to diverse CSCW attendees. The Workshop Chairs will select CSCW workshops based on the quality of the proposal, the composition of the organizer team, including the team’s diversity, the topical relevance, timeliness, and demonstrated ability to run the workshop successfully. 
      </div>

      <div class="page-text">
        Depending on the volume and composition of submissions, we may ask high-quality yet overlapping proposals to consider modifying their submissions (i.e., by combining organizing committees). You will be notified of any requests/changes upon notification/acceptance. 
      </div>


       <h3>NEW ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT</h3>

       <div class="page-text">
        To ensure a high-quality and engaging experience for all participants, <strong>all workshop organizers are expected to be in attendance for the workshop.</strong> The reputation and expertise of organizers are key factors for potential attendees when deciding where to submit, and their active presence is vital for leading discussions, fostering networking, and contributing to the workshop’s success. Accordingly, only individuals who commit to attending the workshop should be listed as official organizers. 
       </div>

		<div class="page-text">
        Contributors who assist with tasks like proposal development or reviewing submissions but do not plan to attend may be acknowledged within the proposal for their specific role, but they should not be listed as primary organizers or authors.
       </div>

    
       <h3>WORKSHOP ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
		
       <div class="page-text">
        The CSCW 2026 Accessibility Co-Chairs are working closely with this year’s Workshop Co-Chairs in welcoming questions, feedback, or guidance about making workshops accessible. If questions related to accessibility arise, please direct them to <a href="mailto:accessibility2026@cscw.acm.org">accessibility2026@cscw.acm.org</a>. 
       </div>

       <h3>PROCEDURES</h3>

       <div class="page-text">
        Workshop proposals should include an abstract and a detailed proposal in the ACM <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow">single-column format</a>. The abstract should be no more than 200 words. The body of the proposal should be at most 3,000 words (excluding references). We require that proposal submissions are accessible. Please review the ACM’s references for organizing accessible conferences (e.g., <a href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/">SIGACCESS’s Accessible Conference Guide</a>). For questions regarding accessibility, please contact accessibility Co-Chairs at <a href="mailto:accessibility2026@cscw.acm.org">accessibility2026@cscw.acm.org</a>. 
       </div>
       
       <div class="page-text">
        Proposals should include the following:

       <div class="page-text">
       Please note that workshops receive minimal technology support. That said, you will likely need to bring some of your supplies. There will be WiFi in the conference area. Organizers should plan to bring their equipment insofar as possible and necessary to execute the workshop (e.g., laptops, portable supplies). We strongly encourage workshop organizers to create web-based resources for their workshops so that advertising, submission, and organization can be handled online.
