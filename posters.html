        <h2>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</h2>

      <div class="page-text">
        Please note that as the CSCW 2026 poster session is fully in-person, <strong>at least one author for each accepted poster must register for the conference and present their work in person.</strong> There will be no online presentation option.

       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe early-stage research outcomes and late-breaking work that provoke discussion among the CSCW community and lead to the emergence of novel ideas. The presentation of a poster has been key to engaging, inspiring, and provocative discussions at CSCW.
       </div>
      
      <div class="page-text">
        Submissions can include, but are not limited to: late-breaking and preliminary results, methodologically sound but early-stage results, contributions by collaborative (inter-)national research projects, innovative and exploratory ideas with or without supporting evaluation or user studies, early student research, and other research best presented in an interactive forum. We invite contributions across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:

       <h2>SUBMISSIONS</h2>

       <h3>GUIDELINES REGARDING SCOPE</h3>

       <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Please note that submissions whose research contributions primarily benefit individual users—and are not relevant to cooperative, collaborative, or social computing—will be considered out of scope.</strong> For example, this would include submissions whose major contribution is on user research findings that inform the design of a system primarily focused on benefiting a sole, individual user. This would also include research on a collaboration between a single user and any number of AI agents. Additionally, systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.
       </div>

		<div class="page-text">
        Therefore, authors should clearly answer yes to the following:
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community?</li>
            <li>Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions?</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>

		<div class="page-text">
        Authors must make sure that their submission is within the scope of the conference. During the submission, authors will be asked to write a short paragraph explaining how this is the case. Contributions out of scope will be desk rejected. 
       </div>

		<div class="page-text">
        If you’re unsure whether your planned submission falls within the scope after evaluating it against the criteria above, you’re welcome to reach out to the Poster Chairs to discuss it.
       </div>

       <h3>POLICY ON USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS IN WRITING PAPERS</h3>
		
       <div class="page-text">
        In line with other SIGCHI conferences’ (e.g., <a href="https://chi2026.acm.org/authors/papers/">CHI</a>) and computing conferences’ (e.g., <a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/CVPRChanges">CVPR</a>) policies on use of generative AI in writing papers, CSCW 2026 employs the following policy on the use of Large Language Models in paper writing.
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text.</strong> Please carefully review the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">ACM Policy on Authorship</a> before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. Note that the LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version. We will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked or where an LLM is not appropriately used (e.g., including fake references generated by LLM, relying on AI-tools to generate ideas in the manuscript, etc.).
       </div>

       <h3>POLICY ON IRRESPONSIBLE REVIEWS</h3>
       
       <div class="page-text">
        ACM <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/peer-review-faq">policies</a> forbid the uploading of author text into an LLM or similar system. Doing so, violates the author’s right to confidentiality and shares intellectual property without consent. Reviewing is a professional responsibility and violations are subject to investigation. In line with other SIGCHI conferences’ (e.g., CHI) and computing conferences’ (e.g., CVPR and KDD) policies on irresponsible reviews, CSCW 2026 employs the following policy on highly irresponsible reviews.
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
       LLMs are NOT allowed to be used for writing the reviews nor the meta-reviews at any step. You cannot use an LLM to write your review. This is true for any LLM, whether you run it locally or use an API.
      </div>

      <div class="page-text">
        This policy includes but is not restricted to:
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>You can NOT ask an LLM to write content for you. The review needs to be based on your own judgment.</li>
          <li>You can NOT share substantial content from the paper or your review with an LLM. This means, for example, that you cannot use an LLM to translate a review.</li>
          <li>You CAN use an LLM to check the grammar of your (meta-)review. If you do so, you also must explicitly disclose/acknowledge this in your review. </li>          
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
       It is also expected that reviewers will submit fair and thoughtful reviews on time. Poster chairs will check (meta-)reviews for highly irresponsible reviews. If a review is flagged as “highly irresponsible,” we will investigate the review. Example cases of highly irresponsible reviews include: reviews that violate the above-mentioned LLM policy, missing or one-sentence reviews, reviews not relevant to the paper or that miss a substantial portion of the paper. Highly irresponsible reviews do not include cases where reviewers merely have some misunderstandings, miss small parts of the paper, or hold a different opinion from other reviewers or the AC. If the review is confirmed as “highly irresponsible,” all submissions to CSCW 2026 by the reviewer will be desk rejected per discretion of the poster chairs. We may also choose to report this incident and this reviewer to the ACM.
       </div>

       <h3>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h3>

       </div>

       <h3>REVIEW PROCESS</h3>

       <div class="page-text">
        Posters receive two  reviews and one meta review from the CSCW 2026 Posters Committee, which will be recruited by the Posters Chairs. We encourage authors to state the contribution and originality of your work clearly and explicitly: What is the problem? How does your approach help? Why is it better than other available approaches? Focus on the contribution of your work rather than just the background, including enough background to make clear how your work differs from significant prior research. 
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">

       <h3>POST-ACCEPTANCE</h3>

       <div class="page-text">
        Authors of accepted posters are required to submit their final camera-ready by <strong>July 10, 2026</strong> for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library and are required to follow <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information">ACM TAPS formatting</a>.
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        As the CSCW 2026 poster session is fully in-person, at least one author for each accepted poster must register for the conference and present their work in person. There will be no online presentation option. Poster authors will need to bring a physical poster that can be displayed during the poster session at the conference. The space allocated for each poster is 48 inches by 48 inches (121 x 121 cm). Posters are recommended to be no longer or wider than 45 inches (114 cm) in either dimension; however, up to 47 inches (119 cm) is allowable. Smaller posters are acceptable. For example, either A0 (vertical format) or A1 is an acceptable size for the poster. More details about the format of the poster session and poster set-ups will be shared with authors of accepted submissions closer to the conference date.
