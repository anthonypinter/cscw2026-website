        CSCW 2026 PAPERS MAY 2025 CYCLE SECOND ROUND DECISIONS
      </h1>

      <div class="page-text">
        We're excited that the second round of CSCW 2026 paper reviewing has wrapped up. Decisions went out on November 11, 2025 and authors that received positive decisions are now working to improve their papers for the upcoming deadlines.

       <h2>REVIEW PROCESS</h2>

       <div class="page-text">
        As a reminder, details about CSCW 2026’s peer review process, timeline, and frequently asked questions (e.g., “Why is the timeline so long?”) can be found in <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2026/blog/reviewprocess.html">our blog published on April 19, 2025.</a>
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">
       As explained in our <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2026/blog/reviewprocess.html">previous blog</a>, CSCW 2026 May 2025 cycle received 637 complete submissions. In the first round of review, these papers were carefully evaluated by a Senior Program Committee (SPC) and a Program Committee (PC) member. After that, 325 papers advanced to the second round of review. Among them, the authors of 11 papers withdrew their submissions and did not submit a revised version. In total, 314 papers were reviewed in the second round.
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">
        In this round, two reviewers external to the program committee were engaged to review each of the papers. A second synchronous online program committee (PC) meeting was held over two consecutive days in early November with the SPCs, PCs, and Papers Chairs to determine decisions for this second round of review and to support mentoring, discussion, and calibration for this phase.
        </div>

        <h2>PAPER DECISIONS</h2>

         <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Conditional Accept with Minor Changes (43 papers):</strong> Submissions that received this decision were nearly ready for publication, and only required a few small changes. The final version of these papers will be submitted for approval by the corresponding SPC and, if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper.
    </div>

     <div class="page-text">
<strong>Revise and Resubmit (208 papers):</strong> Submissions that received this decision have real potential, but will require major portions to be rewritten or redone. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same SPC, PC, and external reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Conditional Accept with Minor changes, or Reject.
     </div>

    <div class="page-text">
<strong>Reject (63 papers):</strong> Submissions that received this decision were not ready for publication. Authors of rejected papers can consider whether to resubmit their papers to CSCW or other venues in the future.
    </div>

        <div class="page-text">
Below, Figure 1 shows the breakdown in paper decisions among the 314 papers reviewed in the second round. Among them, 33.8% papers received a final decision (Conditional Accept with Minor Changes, or Reject), and 66.2% papers received a Revise and Resubmit decision.

            <!-- PAPER DECISIONS PIE CHART FOR ROUND 2-->


    <div class="page-text">
       Figure 2 shows the paper decisions for all 637 complete submissions to the CSCW 2026 May 2025 cycle so far. Among them, after two rounds of reviews, 67.4% papers have already received a final decision (Conditional Accept with Minor Changes, Desk Reject or Assisted Desk Reject, and Reject), and 32.7% will go through Revise and Resubmit. <strong>As we explained in <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2026/blog/reviewprocess.html">our blog published on April 19, 2025</a>, these results do align with our expectation that many papers would receive a final decision much earlier (i.e., by November 11, 2025) than the final decision announcements in March 2026.</strong>

      <h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>

<div class="page-text">
Authors that have received a Revise and Resubmit decision must revise and resubmit their paper by <strong>January 13, 2026</strong>. Resubmissions will be assigned the same SPC, PC, and external reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions by late March 2026: <em>Conditional Accept with Minor changes</em>, or <em>Reject</em>.
</div>

       <div class="page-text">
Congratulations to all authors of conditionally accepted submissions. We also hope that the second round reviews will provide all authors with constructive feedback on how to improve their submissions, so they can either be accepted at CSCW after Revise and Resubmit or at other venues. We thank our dedicated team of SPCs, PCs, external reviewers, and paper authors for investing their precious time in our review process and timeline and for contributing to the growth of the CSCW community.
