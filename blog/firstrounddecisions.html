       <h2>Review Process</h2>

       <div class="page-text">
       As explained in this blog (https://cscw.acm.org/2026/blog/reviewprocess.html), CSCW 2026 has made adjustments to our peer review process outlined in the Call for Papers, including: (1) Introducing a Senior Program Committee (SPC) and a Program Committee (PC), (2) Refining the Desk Rejects/Assisted Desk Rejects phase, (3) Adding online Program Committee meetings (one for the Assisted Desk Reject phase and the other for the Resubmission of papers that received a Revise for External Review recommendation), and (4) Refining the External Review cycle. 
        </div>
    

       <div class="page-text">
      To facilitate these changes, the Papers chairs formalized selection criteria to recruit experienced SPCs and PCs. Generally, CSCW 2026 SPCs are 5+ years post-PhD, have served multiple times as CSCW Associate Chairs (ACs) or Editors, and regularly publish at CSCW. Most CSCW 2026 PCs hold PhDs, have previously reviewed for CSCW or related HCI venues, and have been the lead author of a published CSCW paper. These criteria broadly align with recent discussions in the CHI Peer Review Working Group about minimum qualifications for AC and Subcommittee Chair (SC) roles at CHI.
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
        As a result of these adjustments, CSCW 2026 takes a tiered approach to reviewing where externals will not need to review papers that are not ready.
       </div>

       <div class="page-text">
      First, the papers chairs assigned a Senior Program Committee member (SPC) to each complete submission. SPCs screened the papers they managed for potential desk reject cases, based on the criteria listed in the CfP (https://cscw.acm.org/2026/papers.html). Papers that did not meet these criteria were then verified by the papers chairs and desk rejected.

    <h2>KEY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS</h2>
    
    <div class="page-text">
        Second, the papers chairs assigned a Program Committee member (PC) to each remaining paper. Both SPC and PC conducted a close read of the paper to identify its strengths, weaknesses, and contributions to CSCW.  PC wrote a review and SPC drafted a meta-review. They each provided an initial assessment (definitely revise for external review, probably revise for external review, neutral, probably assisted desk reject, and definitely assisted desk reject). After the PC review was completed and checked for quality, the SPC and PC started a discussion to generate a preliminary recommendation, if possible, for each paper (whether to continue for external review or not). 


    </div>

    
    <div class="page-text">
        Third, as a new addition to CSCW’s review process, the papers chairs held a synchronous online program committee (PC) meeting over two consecutive days with the SPCs and PCs to determine decisions for the first round of review (Revise for External Review or Assisted Desk Reject). We discussed papers with a range of decisions and S/PC agreement to help calibrate the committee and mentor new PCs. We found that having the PC meeting at this stage was highly valuable to the CSCW community. The whole committee counseled together and shared/established norms of publishable CSCW research. Drawing on collective memory, many years of experience, and diverse expertise, this process enabled us to support newer PCs and provide mentorship. PC meetings also served as a tool for accountability since SPCs and PCs presented their recommendations to their professional community.

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: PACM HCI is a journal and thus there are some differences between what authors may be used to compared to a typical CS conference review timeline. Journal papers must offer the opportunity to revise (although a paper can be rejected before they get to this point if the editorial committee feels it is not yet ready). <strong>This revision period must be at least 8 weeks for PACMHCI papers.</strong> This is a mandatory requirement by the PACMHCI journal. The goal is to refine papers until they are ready for publication, without wasted effort (e.g., 4 reviews all pointing out the same major flaw). Thus, we take a tiered approach to reviewing where externals will not need to review papers that are not ready. We introduce the 4 week revision cycle before papers go out to external review so that issues the senior program committee member (SPC) and program committee member (PC) point out can be fixed, leaving external reviewers to spend their time reviewing a paper closer to being acceptable. This takes more time than sending out a paper for review in parallel, but saves volunteer time and burden. It also increases the chance that papers could be accepted with minor revisions after external review.  <strong>Given the paper will have already undergone a round of revision focused on the major concerns of the SPC and PC, we anticipate many more papers will be acceptable after the initial external review round than in past years (i.e., November 11, 2025).</strong> As a result, many papers should not require all rounds of revision and will be accepted much earlier <strong>(<em>i.e.</em>, November 11, 2025)</strong>. Papers that need more rounds of revision will be able to have them.
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        Additionally, as explained earlier in this blog post, we see the significant value of Program Committee (PC) meetings for bringing the community together to calibrate and ensure a fair decision making process for each paper. Therefore, we will also hold two virtual PC meetings in the CSCW 2026 paper review process. One will be for the Assisted Desk Reject phase, and the other will be for the Resubmission of papers that received a Revise for External Review recommendation. Planning and holding these PC meetings will add extra time to the paper review process. However, we believe that it is critical to add PC meetings back to CSCW to ensure that we can have fair decisions for every paper as a community effort. As we are an international community, we also carefully worked around holiday schedules in various cultures to help our volunteers avoid working during holidays (e.g., Christmas, Thanksgiving, Lunar New Year).

        <strong>Q: What is “Revise for External Review”?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: As explained above, we introduce the 4-week revision cycle before papers go out to external review so that issues the senior program committee member (SPC) and program committee member (PC) the ACs point out can be fixed, leaving external reviewers to spend their time reviewing a paper closer to being acceptable. This takes more time than sending out a paper for review in parallel, but saves volunteer time and burden. It also increases the chance that papers could be accepted with minor revisions after external review.  Given the paper will have already undergone a round of revision focused on the major concerns of the SPC and PC members, we anticipate many more papers will be acceptable after the initial external review round than in past years. Many papers should also not require all rounds of revision and will be accepted much earlier.

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: The CSCW external reviewing period overlaps with the CHI 2026 reviewing process. How will the community manage these overlapping activities?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: With CSCW’s multi-phase, journal-based reviewing process distributed over many months, some overlap with other major conferences is inevitable. Nonetheless, the reviewing work for CSCW ACs will actually occur before the CHI submission deadline. The overlap is between the CSCW 2026 external review phase and CHI 2026 paper reviewing phase. While this is unfortunate, it is better than in prior years when AC work overlapped between the conferences. External reviewers are usually reviewing fewer papers than ACs. Furthermore, based on prior paper review data, we anticipate that the CSCW tiered review process will result in a substantial reduction in the number of papers requiring external reviews. Moving the external review earlier to avoid overlap would then shorten the amount of time ACs have to review and manage papers. Not having enough time to properly review, make quick reject decisions, and invite externals has been a key source of low quality reviewing and so we have decided not to truncate that timeline.

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: That is a really long timeline for me to find out if my paper will be Desk Rejected or Assisted Desk Rejected. </strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: We have a much shorter timeline for initially identifying desk rejected papers (June 2025), although this can occur later in the process if it is discovered at a later point in time (e.g., sometimes anonymization problems are not initially spotted). Assisted Desk Rejects will also occur fairly early in the timeline (August 2025).
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: Why are there multiple PC meetings? </strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: One PC meeting will be for the Assisted Desk Reject phase, and the other will be for the Resubmission of papers that received a Revise for External Review recommendation. Planning and holding these PC meetings will add extra time to the paper review process. However, we believe that it is critical to add PC meetings back to CSCW to ensure that we can have fair decisions for every paper as a community effort.
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: How many papers do you expect to go out to external review?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: We have looked at the data from last year on when papers were accepted or rejected and how. There is extremely high alignment between the ACs recommendations and external reviewer recommendations. Thus, we believe that this modified process will save on superfluous volunteer time by external reviewers, with a fairer process for identifying papers to be rejected at the AC review stage. Projecting last year’s numbers onto the adjusted review process, we can anticipate a paper timeline of:
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>~15%-20% Desk Reject (June 2025)</li>
            <li>~30% Assisted Desk Reject (August 2025)</li>
            <li>~50% Go to External Review (Authors notified August 2025, Submit revision Sept 2025)</li>
            <li>~25% Receive a decision, ~25% Go to final round of Major Revision (Authors notified Nov 2025, Submit revision Jan 2025)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: Can I make changes to the author list (such as adding a new author or removing an existing author) after I submitted my paper(s)? </strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: As highlighted in the PCS submission form, <strong>the author list cannot be edited after the paper submission deadline.</strong> Please note that this also applies throughout the paper review process until a final accept/reject decision is made - new authors cannot be introduced for a major revision. CSCW 2026 has this policy to ensure the fairness of our peer review process, such as avoiding potential conflicts of interest that can emerge if new authors are added after the review process has begun. This policy is also consistent with other SIGCHI venues such as CHI, which does not allow such changes after the paper submission deadline. 
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: When will the accepted papers be published in PACM HCI? </strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A:  We anticipate many papers will be acceptable after the initial external review round (i.e., November 11, 2025). We plan to publish these papers in the PACM HCI Spring 2026 issue. Papers that are accepted after Revise and Resubmit (i.e., accepted in March 2026) will be published in the PACM HCI Fall 2026 issue. 
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: What options are there for papers that are rejected after this review process?         </strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: They can be resubmitted to CSCW 2027 or other HCI venues (e.g., CHI). 
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: When will PCS open for paper submissions?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: We will usually open the submission system on PCS two weeks before each deadline (submission and revision).
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: Where/when will be CSCW 2026?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: CSCW 2026 will be held in the USA in October 2026. 
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">
        <strong>Q: Would CSCW 2026 offer hybrid attendance options?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="page-text" style="padding-top:0">
        A: We are certainly considering various attendance options for attendees. We are exploring a wide range of possibilities for how this looks (from live streaming keynotes and panels to asynchronous viewing), but the final decision will largely be shaped by financial constraints and we are unable to project what that will be at this time. Also, attending the conference is not a condition of publication - accepted papers will be published in the PACM HCI journal (where ACM Open Access fees may apply) and conference attendance is a separate decision.
